  "I was born on the 5th of December 1997, in Turkey. I graduated from Bor Science High School in 2016. After that, I ranked in the top 1% of candidates in the university entrance exam, which has over 2 million participants, and achieved to study at one of the best universities in Turkey, Sabancı University.",
  "I decided to study Computer Engineering before I started high school. While I was in high school, I have learned C++ and Python myself by taking online courses and practicing demo projects. It was at that age, I knew building an endless world in the computer will always be my passion.",
  "Throughout years of my undergraduate education, I developed myself in different fields of computer science with this passion. I took courses in the fields of software engineering, data science, cyber security, and many other theoretical and foundational lectures about computer science. I excelled my skills in different programming languages such as C++, C#, Java, Python, and Javascript.",
  "In my senior year, I started working as a part-time software developer, which turned into a full-time job after graduation. From that day, I have gained 3 years of successful and productive software engineering experience in the fintech, blockchain, and e-commerce sectors.",
